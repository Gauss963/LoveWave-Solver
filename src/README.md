Here is a README.md file for your project:

# Love Wave Simulation

This project implements a Love wave simulation using C++. It consists of multiple source files for wave modeling and utility functions.

## File Structure

- **`LoveWave.hh`** - Header file defining the Love wave class and its properties.
- **`LoveWave.cc`** - Implementation of the Love wave class, including wave propagation and related computations.
- **`utils.hh`** - Header file for utility functions used across the project.
- **`utils.cc`** - Implementation of utility functions.
- **`main.cc`** - Entry point of the simulation, where the Love wave model is instantiated and executed.

## Compilation and Usage

### Dependencies
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or equivalent)
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (if used in the implementation)

### Compilation
Run the following command to compile the project:
```zsh
g++ -o love_wave main.cc LoveWave.cc utils.cc -I/path/to/eigen -O2
```
Replace /path/to/eigen with the actual path to the Eigen library if needed.

Execution

After compilation, execute the program using:

./love_wave

Features
	•	Love wave propagation modeling
	•	Numerical computations for wave behavior
	•	Utility functions for mathematical operations
